### How to run
* cp config.sample.json config.json
* npm install
* node server.js
* Open [http://localhost:8080]

### TODO
* Documentation for what this project is, how to build and how to run.
* Add a question before master off
* Support i18n / l10n
* Maybe add some kind of administration interface, so we do not need to modify the config.json
